# SRP-Project

This project serves as my hands-on exploration of Unity SRP, featuring an art scene specifically designed to test Physically-Based Rendering materials and baked lighting interactions. All code includes thorough comments with implementation rationale, partially based on [Catlike's SRP Tutorial](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/custom-srp/).
